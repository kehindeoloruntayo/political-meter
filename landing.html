        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <p>Kehinde's Political Meter is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world. We conduct public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis and other data-driven social science research. We do not take policy positions.</p>

      <p>We generates a foundation of facts that enriches the public dialogue and supports sound decision-making. Our public opinion surveys allow the voice of the people to be heard, and our demographic, economic and political analyses provide context to understand how the world is changing. We are nonprofit, nonpartisan and nonadvocacy. Our mission is to inform, not to prescribe. We believe that better information can build a better world.“Fact-based information is the fuel democracies run on—the raw material from which societies identify problems and construct solutions.”</p>
      <h2>OUR RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>We study a wide range of topics including politics and policy; news habits and media; the internet and technology; religion; race and ethnicity; international affairs; social, demographic and economic trends; science; research methodology and data science; and immigration and migration.</p>
